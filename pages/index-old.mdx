## Why?

People often mention mental illnesses or make a joke without realizing how. By doing that they are hurting those who have the mental illness. By joking about it, you slowly change what people think when they hear the word, and that hurts the people who actually have the illness.

Misinformation or little information is the cause. This site aims to combat this using easy-to-understand pages about various illnesses. With understanding, the hope is that that language can become more inclusive.

The goal isn't medical accuracy. That would work inverserly to lose people reading beause of the complexity. The goal is to get people to rethink their definitions and consider how their languange is hurtful.
