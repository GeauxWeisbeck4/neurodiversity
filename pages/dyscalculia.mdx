# What is Dyscalculiia?

Dyscalculia is a mental disorder affecting how the brain perceives and processes numbers. People with it have a harder time doing tasks that would be considered simple by others, such as reading clock or doing a calculation.

The DSM-5 defines Dyscalculia as:

<Definition>
<DefinitionItem summary="A problem with mathematic that occurs within 3 to 6 percent of the population">

1. “Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive, unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.”
2. “The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).”

<DefinitionItem summary="Being lazy">
Dyscalcualia fundamentally makes it harder to do certain things. It is not something that can be overcome with sheer will.

<DefinitionItem summary="A joke or meme">
Dyscalculia isn't something to take lightly. It affects the lives of those with it in a negative way. Joking or spreading memes is disrespectful of those suffering.

<DefinitionItem summary="Frustrating">
Things taken for granted, like reading a clock, are harder than for most people. Other parts of society not well adapted for people with Dyscaluclia are also harder, with school being a notable example.
</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="Making it harder to do math">
People with Dyscalculia have a harder time recognizing and understanding numbers. They can lose track while counting or need longer time for tasks considered simple for others. This puts them at a disadvantage.
</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="Making it harder to determine between left and right">
Dyscalculia makes left and right confusing. Both in terms of understanding when others say either, and when planning in the mind.

<DefinitionItem summary="Making budgeting and money harder">
Tasks such as estimating the cost of the items in a shopping basket or budgeting are significantly harder

## What can I do?

1. **Stop teasing people about not being able to do things you think are easy.** People with Dyscalculia do not have the same ability to do some things.
2. **Spread awareness!** When you find someone with an incorrect definition of Dyscalculia, send them this page.
