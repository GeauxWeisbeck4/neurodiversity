# Not OCD

This is the source code of the Next.js website [notocd.com](notocd.com). The website is amied to educate the general public about the mental illness OCD. It is meant to be a quick link to send to anyone who has an incorrect mental model of OCD.

I'm not an amazing writer, therefore spelling RPs but also general feedback is hugely appreciated.
