# Neurodiversity

This is the source code of the Next.js website [neurodiversity.wiki](https://neurodiversity.wiki). The website is aimed to educate the general public about mental disabilities. It is meant to be a quick link to send to anyone who has an incorrect mental model.

## Features

- Summarized as to not loose impatient readers
- Includes medical definition, but does not rely on it (due to complex langauge)
- Links to other materials for those who want to learn more
- Extremely sharable (short link)
- Aims to be "better than nothing" (which is the baseline for most people's knowledge)
