# What is ADHD?

ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder which manifests as a constellation of symptoms relating to executive function deficit. The name is a misnomer, which likely stems from the stereotype of the condition; which is that of motor hyperactivity and inattentiveness.

Over the years, understanding of the neurobiology of ADHD has led us to the knowledge that ADHD is in fact an impairment in the executive function of the brain, involving the prefrontal cortex and adjacent structures involved in regulating said functions. Studies have found either structural developmental defects or defects in the production/clearance of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the regions involved.

<DefinitionItem summary="Being lazy">
People with ADHD have what is known as an interest based nervous system, where they are motivated by novelty, challenge, urgency and interest. (see Section: Neuroanatomy of ADHD)
</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="Not trying hard enough">
Due to the deficits in the prefrontal cortex, people with ADHD employ what is known as a “bottom top motivation pathway” to motivate themselves. They cannot materialise motivation from thin air unless there is an immediate reward they can perceive with their 5 senses.

<DefinitionItem summary="Never being able to focus">
We can focus on a thing for even longer than an NT person can and sometimes even forget needs like food and sleep, it's called hyperfocus and it can happen when we're doing something we enjoy.

<DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty regulating focus and motivation">
Our brains are constantly bombarded with millions of stimulus around us like colors, sights, sound, smells and movements. A neurotypical brain is able to filter out unnecessary stimuli and allowing the relevant information to pass through. People with ADHD on the other hand are unable to filter out these stimuli, causing us to be overwhelmed and unable to focus on the task at hand
</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="Emotional dysregulation">
People with ADHD tend to experience emotions more severely and tend to report having more visceral symptoms when in distress. This is due to the deficits in regulation of the areas of the brain involved in filtering excessive emotional responses (see section: Neuroanatomy of ADHD)
